109,Speech,"Your hair is looking really cool, Blaze. Did you do something different with it?",StartingScene
110,Speech,Yeah! I did! Thanks for noticing!,StartingScene
111,Speech,"This style of hair is kind of a rite of passage for my family, so it's now my time to carry that torch.",StartingScene
112,Speech,"One day I'll have locs so long, they'll reach the floor!",StartingScene
113,Speech,Ooo! I can't wait!,StartingScene
114,Speech,So...learn any new spells recently?,StartingScene
115,Speech,Why do you want to know?,StartingScene
116,Speech,I'm just curious.,StartingScene
117,Speech,"I know your game, V.V.. You're trying to get ahead of me in Conjuration class, but it's not gonna work!",StartingScene
118,Speech,I'm not taking Conjuration this semester. I'm in Evocation for my magic focus requirement.,StartingScene
119,Speech,Hmph. I'm not buying it.,StartingScene
120,Speech,Ugh...,StartingScene
121,Speech,I should get back to stalling until J.J. gets here.,StartingScene
122,Speech,Here's hoping he gets here soon.,StartingScene
123,Speech,( Guh...I should probably leave. This conversation is going nowhere.),StartingScene
124,Speech,"Hey, V.V....",StartingScene
125,Speech,"Yes, Dahlia?",StartingScene
126,Speech,I notice you've been paying extra attention to Ray recently. Do you have a crush on him?,StartingScene
127,Speech,You know you can tell me.,StartingScene
128,Speech,...,StartingScene
129,Speech,"Listen, I get it. It must be tough knowing that you don't have a chance with him, but down't give up.",StartingScene
130,Speech,Just be true to you.,StartingScene
131,Speech,Mm.,StartingScene
132,Speech,So...you excited for your birthday next week?,StartingScene
133,Speech,"Yes and no. I mean, it's exciting because this is the first time my parents are allowing me to have a party...",StartingScene
134,Speech,But I'm not sure if my face will be clear in time.,StartingScene
135,Speech,"Well, it's just going to be you, your parents, Blaze, J.J. and me at the party, right?",StartingScene
136,Speech,The family and friends who care about you most! None of us would ever think about making fun of you.,StartingScene
137,Speech,J.J. would.,StartingScene
138,Speech,J.J. *might*,StartingScene
139,Speech,"Regardless, the gift I have planned for you will make you forget all about it. I'm really excited to show you!",StartingScene
140,Speech,I can't wait to see it.,StartingScene
141,Speech,So...,StartingScene
142,Speech,So?,StartingScene
143,Speech,Uh...are you excited about the field trip today?,StartingScene
144,Speech,"Yeah, I'm pretty pumped for it.",StartingScene
145,Speech,"That is, if Mr. Whittrapper ever stops with his nap.",StartingScene
146,Speech,I should go wake him up huh?,StartingScene
147,Speech,"But J.J.'s not here yet, so maybe we can wait a few more minutes.",StartingScene
148,Speech,I wish he could at least make the effort of getting to class on time.,StartingScene
149,Speech,We shouldn't have to be delayed just because of him.,StartingScene
150,Speech,"Well...the school is pretty far from his house, so he has to come a long way to get here.",StartingScene
151,Speech,But aren't you guys next door neightbors?,StartingScene
152,Speech,Yeah...,StartingScene
153,Speech,And somehow you manage to get to class early or on time every day.,StartingScene
154,Speech,...Uh...,StartingScene
155,Speech,Sigh...,StartingScene
156,Speech,"I won't wake up Mr. Whittrapper just yet. Only cause it's for you, V.V..",StartingScene
157,Speech,"Thanks, Ray.",StartingScene
158,Speech,"So, uh, I'm gonna head out now.",StartingScene
159,Speech,"All right. Till next time. And one last thing, V.V.",StartingScene
160,Speech,Y-yeah?,StartingScene
161,Speech,Take it easy.,StartingScene
162,Speech,Okay.,StartingScene
163,Speech,So Egan...uh...I don't know the best way to say this...,StartingScene
164,Speech,You want to know what's going on with my face?,StartingScene
165,Speech,Yeah...,StartingScene
166,Speech,Did you know that trees could get acne? Because I didn't!,StartingScene
167,Speech,Apparently most dryads in my genus get these bumps on their face during this season.,StartingScene
168,Speech,Oh...,StartingScene
169,Speech,I was in my tree form because I didn't want to give Dahlia more opportunities to mock me.,StartingScene
170,Speech,"What? Ugh, that's so unnecessary.",StartingScene
171,Speech,You're telling me.,StartingScene
172,Speech,Maybe after school today we can stop by the library and we can look up some home remedies.,StartingScene
173,Speech,"One of the perks of having a librarian mom, she taught me to find the books I need with ease.",StartingScene
174,Speech,"I...I would really appreciate that, V.V., thanks.",StartingScene
175,Speech,"Anytime, Egan!",StartingScene
176,Speech,"I haven't had a chance to see you over the weekend, what were you up to?",StartingScene
177,Speech,"Oh you know, just helping my older sister get ready for her coronation. The regular duke stuff.",StartingScene
178,Speech,So...you could say that you were...duking it out?,StartingScene
179,Speech,Pfft....,StartingScene
180,Speech,Hahahahaha!,StartingScene
181,Speech,"Oh gosh, why do I always laugh at those bad jokes?",StartingScene
182,Speech,Because they're genius that's why.,StartingScene
183,Speech,So...how was your weekend?,StartingScene
184,Speech,It was pretty good actually. Spent a lot of time out in the sun.,StartingScene
185,Speech,Not that you would know what that's like...,StartingScene
186,Speech,"Because, you know, you're a vampire.",StartingScene
187,Speech,Sigh...,StartingScene
188,Speech,"( I *could* waste my breath in explaining that sun sensitivity isn't a real thing for vampires, but there's no point.)",StartingScene
189,Speech,"Well, Egan, I have to get back to stalling for J.J. so he doesn't miss out on the field trip.",StartingScene
190,Speech,All right.,StartingScene
191,Speech,...,StartingScene
192,Speech,You're not going back into your tree form?,StartingScene
193,Speech,Nah...may as well uproot myself.,StartingScene
194,Speech,"Thanks for checking up on me, V.V.",StartingScene
195,Speech,I appreciate it.,StartingScene
196,Speech,Any time!,StartingScene
197,Speech,Peace.,StartingScene
198,Speech,Well this has certainly been unpleasant.,StartingScene
199,Speech,As always.,StartingScene
200,Speech,Talk to you only when it's absolutely necessary!,StartingScene
201,Speech,"So, what else is going on with you?",StartingScene
202,Speech,Not much. Just trying to keep up with you in all our classes.,StartingScene
203,Speech,"From your battle skills to magic abilities, I can tell you're going to be a top mercenary one day.",StartingScene
204,Speech,You're talking about my ability?,StartingScene
205,Speech,You're the one that's already mastered a weapon class. ,StartingScene
206,Speech,Most of us won't be able to do that until we get to the upper school.,StartingScene
207,Speech,"Oh, you flatter me. It's just all in the wrist.",StartingScene
208,Speech,"Eeeheehee, yeah.",StartingScene
209,Speech,...,StartingScene
210,Speech,...,StartingScene

259,Speech,We will start the field trip without him. I got ya., 
260,Speech,"Still, he's always late. Maybe this could be a teaching moment for him.", 
261,Speech,"His house is really far from the Academy, Blaze. Cut him some slack.", 
262,Speech,V.V....aren't you two next door neighbors?, 
263,Speech,Uh..., 
264,Speech,"But hey! No worries. I don't mind waiting a little while longer. In the meantime, anything else you want to talk about?", 
265,Speech,Hey., 
266,Speech,..., 
267,Speech,"It's just me, Egan. Unless, you're not up for talking. Then I can leave you alone.",

274,Speech,"[expression:Delight]Morning, V.V.!", 
275,Speech,Did I miss anything?, 
276,Speech,"[expression:Confuse]Nope, but Mr. Whittrapper is having Noah collect the permission slips while he takes a nap in the back of the room.", 
277,Speech,[expression:Shock] Oh wow... [wait:2] [expression:Annoy] Who knew that being teacher's pet came with benefits? What privilege., 
278,Speech,"[expression:None]Haha. Still, you should probably get that to him.", 
279,Speech,[expression:None] Right., 
280,Speech,[expression:Confuse] Do you remember how to get that out?, 
281,Speech,[expression:None] *Insert technical instructions here*, 
282,Speech,"Okay! As always, thanks Blaze!", 
283,Speech,No problem! Now hurry and get your permission slip in so we can get started soon!, 
284,Speech,"I mean, J.J. is still late, so I guess we still have to wait for him, but even so!", 
285,Speech,"Yeah, that sounds like him, haha.", 
286,Speech,"[expression:Shock] Oh, good. I made it to class on time.", 
287,Speech,"[expression:None] Today's the big school trip, so I hope I'm not keeping everyone waiting.", 
288,Speech,"If J.J. isn't here, and I turn in my permission slip, Noah will wake up Mr. Whittraper and he'll end up missing out on the field trip.", 
289,Speech,Maybe I can pass the time by talking to the rest of my classmates.,
